Trying to create a "transaction manager" just to start learning python and learn how to use Git/GitHub.

When launching the program, the user can either add a new transaction or check transaction history.

When entering a new transaction, the user is asked to input currency, amount, exchange rate and the type of transaction (debit/credit). When created, the transaction
also includes the date at which the new transaction was registered.

When the new transaction is finally entered, the system displays the total amount (amount * exchange rate) of both credit and debit transaction and shows all previously
entered transactions. The user can then choose to either exit the program or enter another transaction.
